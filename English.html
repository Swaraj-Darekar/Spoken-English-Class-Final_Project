                In addition to grammar, we focus on expanding your vocabulary and improving your sentence formation. Many individuals, regardless of their background, face similar challenges when speaking English, particularly with grammar. Often, people understand English well but struggle to express their thoughts fluently. In many cases, this hesitation stems from unclear language concepts. Our English speaking classes are designed to clarify these concepts, ensuring that you speak with confidence, knowing your English is correct. This newfound clarity will boost your confidence in conversations and interactions.
